       Altitude varies greatly based on balloon size, payload, and volume of helium. For a 600g balloon, we can expect anywhere from 60,000 to 110,000 feet of altitude from payloads from 1 to 12 pounds. Below are some resources to consider using:

       At the lowest estimate of 60,000 feet above sea level, we have a temperature of -26.13 C, pressure of 21.96 pascals, and air density of 0.03097 kg/m^3.
