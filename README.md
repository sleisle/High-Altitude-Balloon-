# High-Altitude-Balloon-
High altitude balloon project

Outline:
•	Hardware
o	Platform
	Computer (Sean)
•	May need to handle several cameras
o	Beaglebone or pi
	Power source (Tom) See if Dom wants to look into this
•	Batteries
•	Solar 
	Sensors (Tom unless specified)
•	Barometer
•	Accelerometer
•	Temperature
•	Camera (Sean)
o	Either several cameras or a gimbal
•	Gps
•	Geiger counter
•	Magnetometer
•	Gas sensors
	Data storage (Sean)
•	Two sd cards
	Communications (Tom)
•	Long distance transmitter
•	Short distance broadcast for location (?)
o	Balloon
	What size balloon
	What gas
	Look into gas release system
	Parachute
Research:
•	Expected conditions at altitude (temp, press)
•	Battery system than tolerates temperatures and pressures
•	Sensors that can handle conditions
•	Case for sensors (consider requirements for barom, geiger, transmitter
•	Expected radiation
•	Protection for high static, high moisture environment (inside cloud)
•	Location
•	Recovery vehicles
